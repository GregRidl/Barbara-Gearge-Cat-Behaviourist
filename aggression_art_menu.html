							<h1 style="font-size:300%;" ><strong><u>Types of Aggression</u></strong></h1><br>
							<img width="700" alt="cat playing in catnip" src="https://i.imgur.com/xaihSCJ.jpg"><br><br>
							<p>Cats can show aggression towards other cats, people or other animal species. Like us, cats don’t always get along with certain individuals based on personalities, behaviour and previous experience. Aggression can be at different levels, from covert to overt.</p>
							<p>Here are some types of aggression with a very brief description of each. Many forms of aggression overlap, and cats can show signs that could be considered one or another aggressive type. There may be different names for some of these in professional or scientific documents. Apart from the last entry, these are listed in alphabetical order.</p>
							<p><strong>Aggression towards people</strong> is mostly as a result of experiences with people; rough play, playing with hands, feet or hair, lack of socialisation, and previous experiences with people.</p>
							<p><strong>Defensive aggression</strong> is when a cat retaliates to a threat.</p>
							<p><strong>Fear aggression</strong> occurs when a cat feels threatened and is not able to defend himself.</p>
							<p><strong>Hunger aggression</strong> occurs when cats that are hungry or searching for food are challenged.</p>
							<p><strong>Inter-cat aggression</strong> occurs between cats that just don’t get along; this may be due to personality, lack of socialisation, or previous experiences.</p>
							<p><strong>Irritable aggression</strong> is mostly caused by a cat being denied something he needs or wants.</p>
							<p><strong>Male cat aggression</strong> is between two or more entire (not neutered) male cats.</p>
							<p><strong>Maternal aggression</strong> is displayed by a mother cat protecting her young.</p>
							<p><strong>Non-recognition aggression</strong> occurs when one cat from the family has been out of the home and returns smelling, looking or sounding different. The other family cats do not recognise him and consider him an intruder.</p>
							<p><strong>Pain-induced</strong> aggression is displayed by cats who are ill, injured or in pain.</p>
							<p><strong>Petting aggression</strong> is an attack on the person doing the petting as the result of over stimulation. </p>
							<p><strong>Play aggression</strong>> occurs when playing turns to predatory behaviour; play becomes a fight.</p>
							<p><strong>Predatory aggression</strong> can occur if a cat is interrupted by an external trigger while hunting. This can also be seen when playing a laser pointer game; cats become frustrated at not catching the light.</p>
							<p><strong>Redirected aggression</strong> occurs when one cat is not able to take his frustration out on the cause of his frustration and turns on the nearest object – another cat or a person.</p>
							<p><strong>Resource guarding</strong> may be considered a form of passive aggression; preventing other cats from using resources or dogs from passing by the cat. This can be a very mild version of territorial aggression, or a ploy to create a diversion to relieve a boring day.</p>
							<p><strong>Status aggression</strong> is an attempt to establish social dominance.</p>
							<p><strong>Territorial aggression</strong> is the defence of a piece of territory, however large or small. This is displayed by both male and female cats, sterilised or not, and any age. Where a person is the ‘territory’, it can be seen as jealously.</p>
							<p><strong>Idiopathic aggression</strong> is diagnosed when all other types of aggression and behaviours have been ruled out; there is no behavioural, medical or logical reason for the behaviour. These cats are unpredictable and dangerous.</p>

						<h1 style="font-size:300%;" ><strong><u>Causes of Aggression in Cats</u></strong></h1><br>
						<img width="700" alt="cat playing in catnip" src="https://i.imgur.com/qoTgT2E.jpg"><br><br>
						<p>There are many reasons for cats to behave aggressively; among the most common are pain or injury, frustration, stress and fear.</p>
						<p>Any injured or ill cat, or one that is in pain, feels vulnerable and lacks the physical and/or emotional ability to properly defend himself. His best method of defence is to attack to remove any real or perceived threat from the other party. Pain may be current pain or the memory or fear of pain associated with a specific individual or event, such as a visit to the vet.</p>
						<p>The aggressor cat can also attack any cat who is feeling vulnerable due to illness or pain, in order to remove that cat and claim ownership of resources. </p>
						<p>Frustration arises when cats are unable to do or get what they want; being kept indoors or their favourite spot is not available. Cats have this in their daily lives; its easy to take your frustration out on someone of your own species and size.</p>
						<p>Stress is an overload of frustrating events. While some cats can deal with a level of frustration, there is a point at which it becomes too much to accept: this spills over into aggression or hiding away to avoid all the triggers.</p>
						<p>Fear is an emotion as the result of a real or perceived threat of danger, harm, pain or change. Cats have an instinctive need to protect themselves as their wild ancestors did: as individuals without a backup system and in charge of their own safety. A fearful cat will use aggressive behaviour to deter anyone from hurting or threatening him.</p>
						<p>Understanding the reason for aggression may help us to reduce the cause and help the cat relax. Constantly being in an aggressive state can lead to health issues.</p>
						<p>As always is the case, a sudden change in behaviour should trigger a visit to the vet to rule out medical or pain issues, as these can often be remedied to reduce the level of aggression.</p>

							<h1 style="font-size:300%;" ><strong><u>Signs of Aggression in Cats</u></strong></h1><br>
							<img width="700" alt="cat playing in catnip" src="https://i.imgur.com/QeSbsai.jpg"><br><br>
							<p>Cats display aggression in different way, using body language, vocalisation and behaviour. Some signs are obvious, some less visible and some are very subtle. The size or volume of the display may not be equal to the level of aggression; some dramatic displays never amount to action while some of the subtlest signals are most aggressive.</p>
							<p><strong>All the signs that are used for aggression are also used for other messages; much depends on the other cats, animals or people involved, the environment and situation. </strong>A cat with a humped back moving sideways towards another can be initiating a game or posing a threat; hissing is a vocal communication that can have many meanings.</p>
							<p>The most obvious signs of aggression are given in body language: stiff legs, standing tall or crouching, raised back, raised fur, head raised or tucked in, looking direct at the target animal, ears back, tail level or lowered, tail lashing, eyes wide open and pupils dilated, whiskers pulled back. </p>
							<p>Actions can include patrolling, stalking, ambushing, chasing, mock attacks, swatting, scratching, biting and fighting while vocalisation includes hissing, spitting, growling, howling, yowling.</p>
							<p>The target cat may exhibit the same or more defensive actions to make him an intimidating opponent or to show he is not a threat: crouching, slinking away, tail tucked in, whiskers may be forward, turning away, head lowered and tucked in, keeping as small as possible and quiet. Rolling onto his side or back is an aggressive move to show all his options – claws and teeth – that he will use if attacked.</p>
							<p>Less dramatic signs of aggression are randomly hitting or pouncing on the target cat with no apparent trigger, elimination outside the litter tray, spraying, general clawing and scratching, staring without other action, patrolling territory, increased vocalisation, always alert, limited or excessive interest in playing, increased or decreased grooming.</p>
							<p>More subtle signals are restlessness, hiding, taking over a space as soon as another cat leaves it, coming between a person and another cat, interrupting another cat while eating or sleeping, looking for high places, preventing other cats from accessing resources (food, water, litter trays, access to outdoors), stealing toys, running away, asking for or rejecting attention, change in eating habits, subtle facial expressions using ears, eyes and whiskers.</p>
							<p>Remember that each cat is an individual with his own ways of expressing his emotions, based on his early socialisation and life experiences. It can be difficult to accurately pinpoint the trigger and the aggressor in a multi-cat household.</p>

							<h1 style="font-size:300%;" ><strong><u>Dealing with Aggression between Cats</u></strong></h1><br>
							<img width="700" alt="cat playing in catnip" src="https://i.imgur.com/f0E3mwm.jpg"><br><br>
							<p>There is no simple formula or rules for dealing with aggressive cats; each situation is different. However, there are general processes for examining the situation and improving the relationship.</p>
							<p>Aggression is a natural behaviour for cats. The occasional argument about a spot in the sun can be considered normal behaviour; when it happens more regularly or when there are other signs of conflict, intervention is needed. Threats can be overt or covert: obvious, easily-recognisable signs or more subtle guerrilla-type actions. </p>
							<p>Punishment does not work for cats; they only learn that you know how to punish them and this can damage your relationship with the cat. Fighting and protecting resources is their aim.</p>
							<p>It is important not to intervene in an aggressive attack as this can lead to additional redirected aggression with yourself as the target; cat bites and scratches can be very serious and may require medical attention. Distract the cats to stop the action.</p>
							<p>Early identification of aggression makes it easier to resolve aggression; before it becomes a habit and the targeted cat begins to modify his behaviour to either retaliate or to remove himself from possible conflict situations.</p>
							<p>The aggressor can be difficult to identify as the targeted cat may retaliate with more force than the aggressor displayed. Learn to read cats’ body language to identify the real aggressor.</p>
							<p>Identify the type of aggression, and the trigger. There is an overlap between types of aggression, making this not an exact decision.</p>
							<p>If there is a chance of medical issues or pain playing a role, have both cats examined by your vet. The aggressor as well as the targeted cat could have medical problems which can be resolved or controlled by timeous intervention.</p>
							<p>Considering the trigger, look at changes than can be made to the environment that could prevent or reduce the event from happening again. Some recommendations are separate areas for the cats, controlled access, or additional resources, including high places.</p>
							<p>Look at ways that our routines and actions can impact on the behaviour; add additional play and grooming session can help cats feel more confident and part of the family.</p>
							<p>Other options that could be helpful include calming remedies, Feliway diffuser, separating the cats and reintroducing as new, puzzle feeders. </p>
							<p>If the aggression cannot be quickly resolved, contact a cat behaviourist.</p>

							<h1 style="font-size:300%;" ><strong><u>Cat Fight – Who started the Argument?</u></strong></h1><br>
							<img width="700" alt="cat playing in catnip" src="https://i.imgur.com/C0QZDVE.jpg"><br><br>
							<p>Domestic cats – males and females - fight more than their wild relatives for a number of reasons: territory, stress, boredom, guarding resources (including people), fear and pain.</p>
							<p>We usually see the tail-end of the conflict – Tom chases Leo, Tom bites Leo, Tom is in trouble and Leo gets the affection and extra snacks. </p>
							<p>Without knowing the lead-up to the confrontation it is impossible to determine who instigated the argument. We need to understand the personalities of both cats, and know what happened in the time before this escalated into a chase. The argument may have started a few minutes before the chase, or this may be the result of a build-up of incidents over a longer time. Don’t make the assumption that the cat being chased is the innocent party.</p>
							<p>Cats will use vocalisation and body language, hissing, growling and puffing themselves up, to appear more dangerous than they are, in an attempt to make their opponent give up and walk away, leaving them with the spoils of the moment. Cats don’t like to waste time and energy on unnecessary fighting and the possible consequence of being hurt. When the cats are evenly matched – or when one cat acts the victim – there will most likely be a chase and fight.</p>
							<p>The cat being threatened may feel more aggressive, more threatened or more protective over the resource under dispute and therefore accept the challenge and succeed in chasing off the contender. </p>
							<p>Or the cat being threatened may feel intimidated or have had a previous experience with the contender, and try to make a run for safety. </p>
							<p>As soon as one cat runs, the prey drive instinct takes over and the chasing cat reverts to his wild ancestors’ instinct, to catch and kill, or at least remove, the fleeing animal. </p>
							<p>Sometimes it seems there is no reason, no prior argument, that causes the attack. There is always a reason, if we look hard enough at the cats involved, the environment, and what is happening at the time of the attack. </p>
							<p>Do not interfere in a cat-fight – at the very least you will come off second-best. Fighting cats are completely focused on the fight and their opponent; any interruption will be seen as another animal taking advantage of the lack of surveillance and the possibility of easy prey, the cats will turn the fight on the person trying to separate them. This is the only time that I would recommend using a water spray to get the cats to stop.</p>
