								<img width="700" alt="cat Paddy snooze" src="https://i.imgur.com/evOgekL.jpg"><br><br>
								<p>There are many reasons why cats wake up early, and why they wake us up too. As with behaviour, if there is a sudden change, a visit to the vet is the first step to resolve any possible medical issue.</p>
								<p>Cats are crepuscular; their most active times are early morning and evening. Researchers have noted that cats kept in captivity eat the most food between 4 and 6am; in nature this would be the coolest part of the day, with prey also being active, and cats would be more camouflaged in the early light.</p>
								<p>Not all cats that are active during the night wake us up. For those that do, understanding the reason will enable us to effectively change the behaviour. Most common reasons are: looking for attention, wanting food, wanting to go outside, needing a clean litter tray, and for elderly cats, pain and disorientation. Cats are excellent at training us once they get us to understand what they want!</p>
								<p>Cats learn from the consequences of their actions: if a behaviour works, they will continue, otherwise first try a few variations, then abandon the behaviour. They donâ€™t waste time and energy on unproductive behaviours.</p>
								<p>Punishment does not work for cats, they are not pack-orientated and are not yet social enough to feel the need to please anyone but themselves. They rather associate the punishment with the person and will either tend to avoid the person or perform the behaviour when the person is not around, making punishment rather futile.</p>
								<p>Here are some general thoughts and ideas on re-training cats; they will not work on every cat! For specific recommendations and a personal plan, please consult a cat behaviourist.</p>
								<p>Attention-seeking cats will change their behaviour when there is no longer any attention - negative attention such as shouting or throwing pillows, counts as attention! Not easy to remember at 3am, but consistently removing any attention will change the behaviour. Cats that want to play may benefit from an energetic game session just before bedtime.</p>
								<p>The behaviour of cats needing food - except for young kittens who really need to be fed - can be improved by changing food or the feeding routine. Splitting the evening meal into two portions, one normal evening feeding time and the other just before you go to bed, can help them to sleep through to the morning. A more nutritious food may be necessary for the late-night meal. Puzzle feeders can be used for the last meal; this will allow the cat to eat over a period of time during the night. A useful tip is to use quiet puzzle feeders, or place them in a location away from the bedroom, otherwise you may be woken up with the noise of solving the puzzles!</p>
								<p>Placing an extra litter tray in the house at night can help those who need to use one. Try different litters, locations, trays etc. until the right combination is discovered.</p>
								<p>Understanding why the cat needs to go out is necessary to changing the behaviour; does he need a clean litter tray, is there something outside that interests him, is it just a habit or is he used to getting his way? How he demonstrates his need to go out may impact on how you work with him to change this. Placing an extra litter tray, comfy bed, toys or treats in a puzzle feeder at the front door may occupy him until you get up. Cats that jump on the bed, meow, bite your toes or lick your face can be treated as those looking for attention. Destructive behaviour by frustrated cats needs to be treated individually.</p>
								<p>Elderly cats with arthritis, and cats recovering from an injury or illness, seem to feel more uncomfortable at night, possibly as they are  expected to stay in one place for longer than they would normally during the day. Keeping them warm, and having a comfortable bed with easy access to food, water and litter tray should help them to sleep better. Calming remedies offered in the evening can help them to relax.</p>
								<p>Cats that become disoriented at night may benefit from being confined to smaller areas that are familiar. Some cats only need a night light to help them find their way around the house.</p>
								<p>Whatever the reason, you cat always feels he is within his rights to wake up when he wants to, and if he needs something, that is what we are there for - to give him what he needs!</p>

								<h1 style="font-size:300%;" ><strong><u>Cats that Bite - Aggression or Protection?</u></strong></h1><br>
								<img width="700" alt="cat Paddy snooze" src="https://i.imgur.com/tMOVIir.jpg"><br><br>
								<p>Biting and scratching are normal activities cats use to defend themselves - when they turn these behaviours on us it is not so nice! There are a number of common reasons that may apply in part or in full to any situation.</p>
								<p>Cats that bite people usually do so to protect themselves; before biting they would have given warning signals which we have not respected, the only option they have left is to use their teeth. Learning cat language and understanding your cat's limits regarding his safety and security will reduce the need to bite.</p>
								<p>Kittens learn from their mother and litter mates how much biting and scratching is acceptable. This training takes place up to 12 weeks' of age; kittens who are not brought up with other kittens and an adult cat have not completed their lessons. Gentle and correct handling is also important at a young age so there is less fear of human contact. Cats who have not been exposed to this initial training are often difficult to handle and bite and scratch.</p>
								<p>Rough play using your hands and feet encourages kittens and cats to be rough in return. We are many times larger and stronger than they are, their only defence is their teeth and claws. Avoid playing with any part of your body, fingers, toes, hair, etc. as this makes us acceptable toys.</p>
								<p>Hunting and chasing  games can get out of hand if the cat becomes overstimulated and cannot catch the toy 'prey', this applies to laser games too.</p>
								<p>Cats that are in pain, injured, cornered or fearful will bite to protect themselves from further pain or attack. They feel vulnerable and the best method of defence is attack. Deaf or blind cats can be frightened by sudden movements and noises that were not anticipated.</p>
								<p>Certain breeds of cats are more highly-strung than others and are therefore more likely to bite in the excitement of a game or petting session. Individuals within a breed will have different personalities and reactions to a situation.</p>
								<p>There is a fine line between pleasurable petting and annoyance. Many cats love to be stroked, scratched and tickled; however there comes a time when that is enough, one more stroke and he attacks. There may be areas on his body that are no-go zones for petting.</p>
								<p>Environment and lifestyle play a part in aggression. If your cat is used to a quiet life and is suddenly exposed to dogs, noise, children or strangers he may bite out of confusion and a lack of experience in dealing with the new situation.</p>
								<p>MomCat is protective over her kittens and will use teeth and claws to make sure they are safe from all 'predators', including those that provide food and admiring words.</p>
								<p>Adult cats will discipline unruly kittens with nips, rarely biting to hurt, just to stop the behaviour.</p>
								<p>When a cat sees or imagines a threat, his body produces adrenaline which needs to be released. If this cannot be directed towards the threat itself it is released on the nearest target, often the human who is trying to protect or help him! </p>
								<p>In a multi-cat household, cats are recognised by sight and smell. If one cat smells different, for example after a visit to the vet, others may not recognise him as family and attack. </p>
								<p>From this list can be seen that biting has many meanings from the perspective of the cat. Consider the situation to identify the reason and the trigger for biting before labelling the cat aggressive.</p>
