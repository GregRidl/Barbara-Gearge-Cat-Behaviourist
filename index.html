				<div class="bookMedia">
					<p>Cats are seen as independent, mysterious and secretive loners; this book offers a look at what makes them behave that way.
					From their ancestors they inherited survival instincts that are still used today; hiding, climbing, posturing to avoid conflict, and even the places they find to sleep.
					<br><br>
					Cats seem to be quiet, yet they are constantly communicating with their body; their whiskers, tails, and ears are signalling all the time, while vocalisation, the messages from their body language and subtle signs are not as easy to decipher.
					<br><br>
					Their lithe and athletic bodies are made for movement, and their intelligent minds can learn and solve challenges even into their senior years.
					<br><br>
					With their extraordinary sensitive senses, cats hear more than we can, see where we cannot and feel vibrations and changes in the atmosphere before the most sensitive equipment. These senses help to keep them out of danger and assist in finding their prey.
					<br><br>
					Cats are amazing; the more we understand how they relate to the environment, and how much our lifestyle is unnatural to them, the better we are equipped to make their lives as comfortable as possible â€“ in turn they show their appreciation in many ways.

					<p>Barbara has been owned by many cats during her life, but it was Creamy with her behaviour issues that led her to investigate possible remedies and therapies. This exercise highlighted the lack of assistance available to cat owners struggling to understand and modify  their cats' behaviour.</p>
					<p>Only one therapy made any impact on Creamy, Tellington Ttouch. Barbara enrolled on the course in 2007, qualifying in 2009. At the same she studied Cat Behaviour through Ethology Academy, at that time run by Professor Odendaal of Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute, qualifying in the advanced course at the end of 2008.</p>
					<p>Since then, Barbara has been helping cats and their owners form a better relationship and understanding.</p>
					<p>Barbara has spoken at conferences, including World Cat Congress Convention in 2019, and written many articles on cats and their behaviour: for the GoSouth website, The Natal Witness newspaper, TICA (The International Cat Association) newsletter, and articles from her Facebook page have been shared around the world.</p>
