							<h1 style="font-size:300%;" ><strong><u>Cats that Under-groom</u></strong></h1><br>
							<img width="700" alt="cat playing in catnip" src="https://i.imgur.com/hYOFL01.jpg"><br><br>
							<p>Cats are known for their fastidious grooming, which is more than just looking good. Grooming removes smells, dust, debris and parasites from the fur while spreading saliva and oil from the base of the hairs over the coat to keep it neat and shiny, stimulates blood flow and controls temperature. It also involves cleaning the ears, eyes, paws and claws, trimming claws and removing as many knots as possible. All this is to keep themselves in good shape and as odourless as possible to avoid detection by potential predators.</p>
							<p>There is no one standard for a correctly-groomed cat; a long-haired outdoor cat will never look like a sleek indoor Siamese. Each breed, and each cat within that breed, has their own standard of grooming and their own natural look. Knowing the grooming standard of your cat will help to identify when there is a change, either- over or under-grooming.</p>
							<p>Any cat that doesn’t keep themselves properly groomed is indicating there is a problem, physically or emotionally. There are many reasons for under-grooming. </p>
							<p>Although keeping clean is a natural instinct for cats, not all cats have the opportunity to learn from their mothers, siblings, or older cats in a colony. The process of grooming is a leant behaviour.</p>
							<p>Cats that are injured or in pain may not feel able to groom themselves. They may not be mobile enough to reach, or it may be painful to move their bodies. When wearing a surgical collar, grooming will be restricted to only those parts o the body that can easily be reached.</p>
							<p>Fat cats and those with arthritis find it difficult to reach all areas of the body. Diabetes, hyperthyroidism and other diseases may change the structure of the coat, making it more difficult to groom.</p>
							<p>Dental and mouth issues make it unpleasant or painful for cats to groom.</p>
							<p>Elderly cats may start to groom but find the task too long and hard to finish.</p>
							<p>Disabled cats may need some assistance to complete their grooming if they are not able to reach all areas of their bodies.</p>
							<p>Caged or confined cats and ones that are fearful of their surroundings can withdraw into themselves to such an extent that they are unable to groom.</p>
							<p>When a cat is dehydrated, there is not sufficient saliva to coat the fur or remove dust and debris.</p>
							<p>Diet plays a role in coat condition; an unhealthy diet results in a scruffy coat, and a hungry cat spends more time looking for food and less on grooming.</p>
							<p>Cats who do not groom themselves sufficiently are more likely to have additional health issues. Dirty ears, eyes, mouths and open wounds are more prone to infection.</p>

							<h1 style="font-size:300%;" ><strong><u>Observation is more than Seeing</u></strong></h1><br>
							<img width="700" alt="cat playing in catnip" src="https://i.imgur.com/FXL35rn.jpg"><br><br>
							<p>Our cats are very subtle in their signs and behaviour; we need to use (almost) all our senses to pick up some of their signals.</p>
							<p>Watching their behaviour, movements, choices as well as sleeping and eating patterns gives us some information.</p>
							<p>Touching is another way we can identify potential issues. As we touch parts of the body we can feel temperature differences, or the way the cat moves away or towards us. Each of these is an observation.</p>
							<p>Listening to their sounds and movements gives us another dimension; a change in vocalisation or a different sound when walking or jumping can indicate an issue.</p>
							<p>Smell is often ignored as a observation. Bad breath or a change in the general body smell of the cat can indicate underlying issues. Smelly paws usually mean they have walked on something unpleasant - and this is an important observation because cats are so careful of where they walk and what they touch.</p>
							<p>Sometimes we just have a feeling that something is not right with our cat; it’s nothing specific, just small items that individually are unimportant, but when out together make a different picture.</p>
							<p>With our minds, we need to consider the signals we receive. What is this? What does this mean? What caused this? Is it temporary - i.e. caused by the current environment? Is it a recurring observation? Is is due to something I have done, or not done? Is it serious? Do I need to do anything about it? What can I do about it?</p>
							<p>As an example, Thor is a messy eater, leaving food all over the place. Listening to him eat, I hear that he doesn’t crunch his food. His breath doesn’t smell as good as the others - he does eat extra food though. A dental checkup found that Thor had a hole on one of his teeth, making it painful to bite or chew. After surgery his breath smells better, but he is still a messy eater, this is the way he learnt to eat to avoid pain, and how he still eats.</p>

							<h1 style="font-size:300%;" ><strong><u>TTouch to Relax Cats</u></strong></h1><br>

							<p>Tellington TTouch is a gentle way of using touch to help animals – and people – to relax. A relaxed cat is better able to make decisions, so this improves behaviour too. The basic touches are built around circles or strokes. For ease of description, I will explain a few of the stroke touches. </p>
							<p>The touches are gentle, no more pressure than allowing your hand to gently rest on the skin or fur. Too light can be ticklish, too heavy can feel awkward. Movements are calm and done with intention and focus on the cat. Too slow can feel creepy, too fast is energising rather than calming. Each cat has their own pressure and speed likes and dislikes; it may take a few tries to get the combination right.</p>
							<p>While doing the touches, observe your cat to see his reaction, listen to the small signals he gives; ears back, tail waving, head turning, skin rippling. Notice the feel of his fur, look for changes in texture and direction of lay. Feel for temperature changes. All of these are only observations, notice the difference each time you work with him, and make an informed decision when necessary. </p>
							<p>Cats absorb the benefit of the touches easily; it is not necessary to spend a long time working with a cat, rather many short sessions a day than one long session. Allow him to make the decision when the session is over; when he walks away or refuses further touches, leave him be.</p>
							<p>A long stroke starting from the head, down the back and off the end of the tail is a good way to start and end a session. Do this 1 or 2 times. This helps to connect the front and back of the body.</p>
							<p>Ears contain acupressure points for many organs of the body. Stroke the ear from the base to the tip with gentle pressure. This is more easily done from the side of the cat. Close your fingers to form a soft fist and use this to support the inside flap of the ear, keeping the ear in the upright position. Using your thumb on the outside of the ear, and starting on the head, stroke the length of the ear and slide off the end. Do a few strokes to cover the whole ear, then do the other ear the same way, using the other hand. For cats with tipped or trimmed ears, estimate where the ear should have ended and stroke to this point.</p>
							<p>The middle line of the head, from the back of the nose to between the ears, is usually a favourite place for a stroke! Gently run one or two fingers, starting between the ears, down and up the middle line, and watch your cat stretch and relax, often with a deep sigh. Many cats will tolerate this for quite a while; watch for signs that he many be feeling overwhelmed – but too relaxed to move.</p>
							<p>Enjoy time spent with your cats; TTouch is relaxing for the person performing the touches too!</p>

							<h1 style="font-size:300%;" ><strong><u>Home Confinement for Cats – Prison or Sanctuary?</u></strong></h1><br>
							<img width="700" alt="cat playing in catnip" src="https://i.imgur.com/5ErzjQ2.jpg"><br><br>
							<p>This article refers only to cats that live with us as companions; rescue centres, catteries, foster homes, breeders and other organisations caring for cats have a different purpose and reason for confining cats, and often a limit to their resources.</p>
							<p>For many cats, a small, known space with the appropriate resources and stimulation, is a safe refuge. They understand the environment, it is safe, they have what they need, and there are no predators or situations they cannot deal with. Their stress levels are lowered, they can relax, show their true personality, and enjoy life to the fullest.</p>
							<p>There are many reasons for confinement, including bringing home a new cat, keeping cats indoors, very timid cats, reducing stress, moving house, separating aggressive cats, recovery from an illness or injury, caring for an older cat and providing a safe space away from dogs or children.</p>
							<p>Different levels of confinement apply for various situations. An over-excited cat may be kept in the bathroom for a few minutes to calm down, keeping cats safe while renovations are in progress, a few weeks to learn the new home, while indoor cats will remain confined for their lifetime.</p>
							<p>The length of the confinement controls the resources and stimulation needed. A few minutes in the bathroom to unwind after a game needs only a warm place to sit on. Caring for a recovering cat depends on his requirements but should contain at least a warm bed, food, water, litter tray and some form of stimulation, as well as visits from the carer for interaction and comfort.</p>
							<p>Brining a new cat into the home, or moving to a new home, requires more resources and stimulation until the cat is settled and ready to be introduced to the rest of the home. The same level of confinement is needed for aggressive cats that need to calm, as this could take a few days.</p>
							<p>Older or timid cats can really benefit from a sanctuary, a quiet place away from the noise and activities of a home, but within reach when they need company. For these cats, confinement may be a special space where they can retire when they feel the need, while still having access to the home, garden and family. These can be stations indoors or outdoors, and should be easily accessible by the cat, but restricted to other animals and people, especially children!</p>
							<p>Indoor-only cats, or those with enclosed gardens or catios, are safe from many dangers and diseases; with the appropriate number of resources, sufficient stimulation that is regularly changed, and interaction with the family, are among the safest and most relaxed cats that live with us.</p>
							<p>Keeping cats safe is healthier, physically and emotionally, for them; our belief that all cats must have access to outdoors is no longer valid in our current lifestyle.</p>
